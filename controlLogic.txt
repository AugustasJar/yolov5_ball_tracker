Default behavior – idle speed forward – search for a ball



Search behavior:

turn clockwise if wall is hit, go anti-clockwise.

If a full rotation is completed extend the search radius by increasing idle speed (?)







Ball found: speed = max, turn towards, pdi control

Set speed to max

If error is positive, decrease left motor speed

If error is negative, decrease right motor speed

When ball is close execute a function (getBall()) to drive forward and trigger the paddle



GetBall():

Count the balls in immediate path

If a wall is detected while getting a ball – abort, turn 90 degrees continue default behavior with turn direction opposite to the found ball

Go forward for x seconds,

If it's successfully completed increment balls to calculate remaining space.



Capacity_full = True or out_of_time = True:

Park()

If not out_of_time - Wait for last 10 seconds or something

Open the back door



Park():

Turn until our qr code is seen

Get close to nnearest wall ?

Turn to qr code ( back camera)

Go to qr code
